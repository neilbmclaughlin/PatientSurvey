HSCIC Patient Survey Exercise Prototype

Notes:
1) Requires Specflow addin for VS2013 
2) You will need to run the SurveyResults integration tests to populate the test data before running the app

Todo

  * Consider replacing file based persistence with something more performant (MSSQL, MongoDB, etc)
  * Remove un-needed controllers and other code
  * Move services into their own project for reuse
  * Add WebAPI controllers to expose data provided by services for syndication
  * Add smoke tests which use headless browser (eg PhantomJS) against deployed application to have full end to end tests
  * Extend unit and integration tests to be more comprehensive
  * Add exception handling
