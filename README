HSCIC Patient Survey Exercise Prototype

Todo

* Consider replacing file based persistence with something more performant (MSSQL, MongoDB, etc)
* Use bootstrap to format hospitals page
* Remove un-needed controllers and other code
* Move services into their own project for reuse
* Add WebAPI controllers to expose data provided by services for syndication
* Add smoke tests which use headless browser (eg PhantomJS) against deployed application to have full end to end tests
